## Trade-Offs in Incremental View Maintenance 

View Maintenance is a fully dynamic algorithm (meaning allows both addition and deletion) to execute on queries on databases.

Setting:  
- Fully dynamic algorithms
- Single tuple updates to relational databases
- Relational queries (non recursive)

A know classical approach are delta queries. Not much is known in terms of trade offs of IVM such as - optimal bounds for  
(i) answer time is faster but updates are slower or (ii) answer time is slower but updates are faster ?

### The Incremental View Maintenance Problem

- The above is a static case for IVM
- Given a query and database, an auxiliary data structure is constructed. The time taken to construct this structure is the preprocessing time.
- Later the user may try to access results of that query, and we have to enumerate the results from the auxiliary data structure.
- The enumeration delay is the maximum of 3 times: (i) the time from the beginning to enumerate the 1st record of the database in some order, (ii) time to enumerate between 1 record and the next and (iii) time between enumeration of last tuple to the end of the enumeration 
- This gives us a more fine grained analysis for the query, since result size may be very large but query may be very simple.

- The above is a dynamic case for IVM
- Update time consists of maintaining both the database and the auxiliary data structure over updates

There are trade-offs between preprocessing time, enumeration delay and update time.
