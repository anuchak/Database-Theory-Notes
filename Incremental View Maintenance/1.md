## Trade-Offs in Incremental View Maintenance 

View Maintenance is a fully dynamic algorithm (meaning allows both addition and deletion) to execute on queries on databases.

Setting:  
- Fully dynamic algorithms
- Single tuple updates to relational databases
- Relational queries (non recursive)

A know classical approach are delta queries. Not much is known in terms of trade offs of IVM such as - optimal bounds for  
(i) answer time is faster but updates are slower or (ii) answer time is slower but updates are faster ?

### The Incremental View Maintenance Problem

- The above is a static case for IVM
- Given a query and database, an auxiliary data structure is constructed. The time taken to construct this structure is the preprocessing time.
- Later the user may try to access results of that query, and we have to enumerate the results from the auxiliary data structure.
- The enumeration delay is the maximum of 3 times: (i) the time from the beginning to enumerate the 1st record of the database in some order, (ii) time to enumerate between 1 record and the next and (iii) time between enumeration of last tuple to the end of the enumeration 
- This gives us a more fine grained analysis for the query, since result size may be very large but query may be very simple.

- The above is a dynamic case for IVM
- Update time consists of maintaining both the database and the auxiliary data structure over updates

There are trade-offs between preprocessing time, enumeration delay and update time. 

### Part I - Main IVM techniques (example of triangle count query)

- This is for single tuple updates to the database
- Simplest way is to compute the delta on the multiplicity instead of full database recomputation
- The updates *may* be -ve, benefit is that updates may be out of order and we do batch updates for parallelization. Later we reconcile based on whether the final multiplicity is -ve or not.
- Some questions from the audience: Q1) Can we do updates on a tuple not in the database at all ? Q2) What happens when we try to join on 2 tuples with -ve multiplicity ?

#### Naive Approach

- Essentially do entire recomputation from scratch

#### Delta Queries:

- Called First Order IVM because the change for the query is being expressed just as another expression in terms of the original query 
- Implemented in most commercial database systems
- Take the delta change for the tuples and then find the intersection between the columns of the Relations to be joined    
  (possible in $O(n)$ ) 

#### Higher Order Incremental View Maintenance:

This was introduced by Christoph Koch (EPFL) in the DBToaster system.

- There can be many joins involved for the view and even after we take the delta we may have to do a lot of work.
- Instead why not materialize some of these joins ?
- Create view over this materialized views and then recursively maintain these views.
- We then have to maintain the materialized views using same delta tracking when there are tuple updates for the  
  Relations in the materialized view

- We join $S \Join T$ and keep a materialized view over $R \Join S \Join T$ (i.e the cycle count query)

- We can now discard $S \Join T$ and just consider $V(b,a)$ for the 2 columns for which updates are being considered

- Now we simply do a lookup in our view, which will take $O(1)$ assuming that the view previously has been materialized.
- We still have $O(n)$ complexity in maintaining this materialized view in case there are updates to the join on $S \Join T$.

- We pay extra cost of $O(N^2)$ in space because we are storing all these joins on disk and also additional cost of maintaining $V(b,a)$ will be $O(N)$
