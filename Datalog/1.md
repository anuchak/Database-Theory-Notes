- For the above specified query (graph reachability) we need recursive operation
- Datalog consists of rules and these rules may have recursion
- The rules are read from right to left
- The $T(X, Y)$ computes the transitive closure between $X$ and $Y$ and exists if there is an edge between $X$ and $Y$
- If there exists an edge between $Z$ and $Y$ and $(X, Z)$ exists in the transitive closure then $(X, Y)$ exists in the transitive closure.
- The rules annotated in black are called extentional database predicates (EDB)
- The rules in blue called intentional database predicates (IDB)
