- For the above specified query (graph reachability) we need recursive operation
- Datalog consists of rules and these rules may have recursion
- The rules are read from right to left
- The $T(X, Y)$ computes the transitive closure between $X$ and $Y$ and exists if there is an edge between $X$ and $Y$
- If there exists an edge between $Z$ and $Y$ and $(X, Z)$ exists in the transitive closure then $(X, Y)$ exists in the transitive closure.
- The rules annotated in black are called extentional database predicates (EDB)
- The rules in blue called intentional database predicates (IDB)

- Immediate Consequence Operator (ICO) is a function that takes as input a state of the IDBs (such as a partial computation done till now) and computes a new state of the IDB ($J'$ ) produced over the relations being computed over.

- There are 3 semantics for Datalog: model theoretic semantics, fixed point semantics and proof theoretic semantics.
- All 3 are equivalent.
- Minimal model semantics: We are looking for that state of the IDBs such that if we apply the ICO, we end up with a subset of the state of the IDBs.
- Least Fixpoint semantics: We are looking to make them equivalent.
